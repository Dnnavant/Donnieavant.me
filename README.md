As a seasoned professional, I'm eager to transition my career to
the world of a web developer. In doing so, Iâ€™d leverage my
previous skills and experiences in effective communication,
collaboration, problem-solving, adaptability, time management, and
professionalism to contribute to a developer role. My enrollment
in web development courses at DCI demonstrates my commitment to
this career change and skill enhancement.
